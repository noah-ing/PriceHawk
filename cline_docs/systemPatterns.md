**Rationale**:
- Critical for handling client-side hooks like useSearchParams() properly
- Prevents hydration mismatches between server and client
- Enables proper dynamic content loading patterns
- Follows Next.js App Router best practices

**Implementation**:
- Clear separation between server components (page.tsx) and client components (page-client.tsx)
- Server components handle initial data loading and pass it to client components
- Suspense boundaries around client components that use navigation hooks
- Loading fallbacks displayed during hydration and data fetching
- Dynamic rendering directives (e.g., 'force-dynamic') for proper behavior
- Server-side searchParams passing to avoid client-side hydration issues

### 9. SiteGround-Specific Deployment Strategy

**Decision**: Implement a PHP-based restart solution to work around SiteGround hosting limitations.

**Rationale**:
- SiteGround hosting lacks native Node.js management tools
- SSH access is restricted by firewall rules, preventing direct GitHub Actions access
- Need for a reliable way to restart the Node.js application after deployment
- Requirement to handle deployment without direct server access

**Implementation**:
- Secure token-protected PHP script (restart-app.php) for application restart
- GitHub Actions workflow to deploy both the application and restart script
- Two-phase deployment approach:
  1. FTP deployment of application files and PHP script
  2. Post-deployment restart triggered via HTTP request to the PHP script
- Detailed documentation of the restart solution
- Token-based security to prevent unauthorized restarts

## React Component Patterns

### React Hooks Best Practices

To ensure consistent behavior and prevent "Cannot update a component while rendering a different component" errors, we follow these patterns:

1. **Hook Order Consistency**
   - All hooks must be called unconditionally at the top level of components
   - No hooks inside conditionals, loops, or nested functions
   - Maintain the same hooks order on every render
   - Move conditional logic inside hooks, not around them

2. **Navigation Pattern**
   ```jsx
   // ✅ CORRECT: Navigation in useEffect with state management
   const [isRedirecting, setIsRedirecting] = useState(false);
   
   useEffect(() => {
     if (condition && !isRedirecting) {
       setIsRedirecting(true);
       try {
         router.replace('/destination');
       } catch (error) {
         setIsRedirecting(false);
         console.error('Navigation error:', error);
       }
     }
   }, [condition, router, isRedirecting]);
   
   // ❌ INCORRECT: Navigation during render
   if (condition) {
     router.replace('/destination'); // This will cause errors
     return <LoadingSpinner />;
   }
   ```

3. **Authentication Flow**
   - Use `useSession({ required: true })` for automatic redirects
   - Maintain a clear loading state during authentication checks
   - Handle all auth states (loading, authenticated, unauthenticated)
   - Prevent redirect loops with careful state tracking

4. **Loading State Pattern**
   - Define loading UI components once and reuse them
   - Use consistent loading indicators across the application
   - Ensure loading states don't trigger unnecessary renders

5. **Suspense Boundary Pattern**
   ```jsx
   // ✅ CORRECT: Server component with Suspense boundary
   // page.tsx (Server Component)
   export default function Page({ searchParams }) {
     return (
       <Suspense fallback={<LoadingComponent />}>
         <ClientComponent initialSearchParams={searchParams} />
       </Suspense>
     );
   }
   
   // page-client.tsx (Client Component)
   "use client";
   
   export default function ClientComponent({ initialSearchParams }) {
     // Safe to use client-side hooks here
     const searchParams = useSearchParams();
     const router = useRouter();
     
     // Component logic...
   }
   ```

## Error Handling Patterns

1. **Authentication Failures**
   - Structured error responses with clear messages
   - Rate limiting for login attempts
   - Secure password reset flow
   - Graceful handling of expired sessions
   - Redirect to login with return URL preservation
   - Multi-layered client-side resilience:
     - JWT wrapper to prevent null payload errors
     - Session error boundary to intercept auth API failures
     - SafeAuthProvider for graceful authentication degradation
     - Fallback session states when authentication fails

2. **Scraping Failures**
   - Retry with exponential backoff
   - Attempt with alternative proxies
   - Fall back to simplified extraction methods
   - Record failure reason for analysis
   - Maintain last known good price until resolution

3. **API Errors**
   - Structured error responses with codes and messages
   - Client-side retry for transient errors
   - Graceful degradation of UI
   - Error logging and monitoring
   - User-friendly error messages

4. **Database Failures**
   - Connection pooling and retry logic
   - Transactions for data integrity
   - Fallback to cached data when appropriate
   - Monitoring and alerting for persistent issues

5. **Deployment Failures**
   - Clear error reporting during deployment
   - Verification steps to prevent partial deployments
   - Recovery options after failed deployment
   - Pre-deployment backups for rollback capability
   - Post-deployment health checks
