## Technical Constraints

### Performance Constraints

1. **Scraping Timeouts**:
   - Real-time scraping must complete within 10 seconds
   - Background scraping can take up to 30 seconds per product

2. **API Response Times**:
   - Dashboard loading: < 1 second
   - Product addition: < 12 seconds (including scraping)
   - General API requests: < 500ms

3. **Concurrency Limits**:
   - Maximum 5 concurrent scraping operations per user
   - Maximum 50 concurrent scraping operations system-wide

### External Dependencies

1. **Retailer Websites**:
   - Subject to change without notice
   - May implement anti-scraping measures
   - Varying page structures and JavaScript requirements

2. **Proxy Services**:
   - Limited number of proxies available
   - Potential for IP blocking
   - Geographic restrictions

3. **Vercel Limitations**:
   - Serverless function execution time limits
   - Cold start latency for infrequently used functions
   - Bandwidth and compute limitations on free/hobby plans

### Security Requirements

1. **Data Protection**:
   - User credentials must be securely hashed using PBKDF2 with salt
   - API routes must validate authentication
   - No sensitive data in client-side code
   - Secure session management with HTTP-only cookies

2. **Authentication Security**:
   - Multiple authentication options for user flexibility
   - Secure password requirements (minimum length, complexity)
   - Protection against common attacks (brute force, CSRF)
   - Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
   - Secure password reset functionality with token-based verification

3. **Scraping Ethics**:
   - Respect robots.txt directives
   - Implement rate limiting to avoid overloading retailer servers
   - No scraping of user-specific or session-based pricing

4. **Input Validation**:
   - All user inputs must be validated and sanitized
   - URL validation to prevent malicious inputs
   - Rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse
   - Form validation with Zod schemas
