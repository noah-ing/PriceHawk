## Next.js App Router Architecture

PriceHawk leverages Next.js App Router architecture with a clear separation between server and client components:

### Server/Client Component Pattern

The application follows a consistent pattern for handling client-side components in Next.js:

1. **Server Components (page.tsx)**:
   - Do not include client-side hooks (useRouter, useSearchParams, etc.)
   - Pass data from the server to client components as props
   - Wrap client components in Suspense boundaries
   - Handle initial data loading
   - Provide loading fallbacks

2. **Client Components (-client.tsx)**:
   - Marked with "use client" directive
   - Handle interactive user interfaces
   - Use React hooks like useRouter, useSearchParams, useState, etc.
   - Receive initial data as props from server components
   - Implement client-side navigation and state management

This pattern ensures proper hydration and prevents common errors like:
- "Cannot update a component while rendering a different component" 
- Hydration mismatches between server and client
- Navigation hooks causing issues during server rendering

### Suspense Boundary Implementation

```tsx
// Example server component (page.tsx)
export default function ProductPage({ searchParams }) {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<ProductLoadingUI />}>
      <ProductClient initialSearchParams={searchParams} />
    </Suspense>
  );
}

// Example client component (product-client.tsx)
"use client";

export default function ProductClient({ initialSearchParams }) {
  const router = useRouter();
  const searchParams = useSearchParams();
  // Rest of client component logic
}
```

## Technical Constraints

### Performance Constraints

1. **Scraping Timeouts**:
   - Real-time scraping must complete within 10 seconds
   - Background scraping can take up to 30 seconds per product

2. **API Response Times**:
   - Dashboard loading: < 1 second
   - Product addition: < 12 seconds (including scraping)
   - General API requests: < 500ms

3. **Concurrency Limits**:
   - Maximum 5 concurrent scraping operations per user
   - Maximum 50 concurrent scraping operations system-wide

### External Dependencies

1. **Retailer Websites**:
   - Subject to change without notice
   - May implement anti-scraping measures
   - Varying page structures and JavaScript requirements

2. **Proxy Services**:
   - Limited number of proxies available
   - Potential for IP blocking
   - Geographic restrictions

3. **SiteGround Hosting Limitations**:
   - No native Node.js management tools unlike some other hosting providers
   - Restricted SSH access and firewall limitations
   - Limited direct process control from external sources (GitHub Actions)
   - Deployment requires a custom PHP-based restart solution
   - PHP script execution limits for long-running operations
   - RAM and CPU allocation limits
   - Process restart policies
   - Disk space constraints
   - Concurrent connection limits

### Security Requirements

1. **Data Protection**:
   - User credentials must be securely hashed using PBKDF2 with salt
   - API routes must validate authentication
   - No sensitive data in client-side code
   - Secure session management with HTTP-only cookies

2. **Authentication Security**:
   - Multiple authentication options for user flexibility
   - Secure password requirements (minimum length, complexity)
   - Protection against common attacks (brute force, CSRF)
   - Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
   - Secure password reset functionality with token-based verification

3. **Scraping Ethics**:
   - Respect robots.txt directives
   - Implement rate limiting to avoid overloading retailer servers
   - No scraping of user-specific or session-based pricing

4. **Input Validation**:
   - All user inputs must be validated and sanitized
   - URL validation to prevent malicious inputs
   - Rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse
   - Form validation with Zod schemas

## Integration Points
