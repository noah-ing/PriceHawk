# Active Development Context

## Current Task
PriceHawk is production ready with a newly added dropshipper-focused dashboard that provides profit metrics and markup settings. The application has been completely fixed for proper Next.js client-side rendering with Suspense boundaries, addressing all build errors and ensuring the application is fully deployable.

We're currently implementing a reliable deployment workflow to SiteGround hosting, working around their limitations regarding SSH access and automated application restart after deployment.

## Recent Changes

- ✅ Fixed Next.js configuration for ES modules compatibility:
  - Updated next.config.js to use ES module syntax instead of CommonJS
  - Ensured compatibility with "type": "module" in package.json
  - Fixed development server startup issues

- ✅ Resolved CSRF token validation failures:
  - Enhanced token handling with more frequent refreshes (5 min interval vs 15 min)
  - Created auto-retry mechanism for CSRF validation failures
  - Added special handling for critical endpoints (scrape, products, alerts)
  - Implemented more aggressive token freshness checking

- ✅ Created comprehensive dropshipper-focused landing page:
  - Strong value proposition focused on profit maximization 
  - Interactive ROI calculator to demonstrate potential savings

### Production Readiness Infrastructure (Previously Completed)
- ✅ Rate limiting middleware with subscription-tier awareness for authentication and scraping protection
- ✅ Comprehensive health check endpoint (/api/health) with database connectivity verification
- ✅ Pre-deployment database backup script with versioning support
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow for automated deployment to SiteGround
- ✅ Production readiness verification script to validate deployment prerequisites
- ✅ Detailed deployment guide with step-by-step instructions

### Security Enhancements (Previously Completed)
- ✅ Tiered rate limiting system that scales with subscription levels
- ✅ Protected authentication routes from brute force attacks
- ✅ Added safeguards for scraping operations to prevent retailer blocking
- ✅ Created CSRF protection with token validation
- ✅ Enhanced JWT token handling with better null-safety and error recovery

## Status
- ✅ User authentication fully functional with Google OAuth and password-based login

- ✅ Product creation and alert management working correctly with CSRF protection enabled
- ✅ NextJS App Router parameter handling fixed for dynamic routes
- ✅ CSRF token handling improved with automatic retry mechanism
- ✅ Rate limiting implemented across all critical endpoints
- ✅ Health check endpoint created and tested
- ✅ Database optimization verified and automated
- ✅ Deployment pipeline configured
- ✅ Production documentation completed
- ✅ Production verification scripts implemented
- ✅ Subscription sync mechanism unified across all pages
- ✅ AlertsPanel fixed for proper product data handling

- ✅ Error handling for API response structure variations implemented
- ✅ Dropshipper-focused landing page completed
- ✅ Pricing page subscription display fixed to correctly reflect current plan
- ✅ Next.js build errors fixed with proper Suspense boundaries for all affected pages
- ⚠️ SiteGround deployment requires PHP restart script solution (implemented but requires testing)

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Production Deployment
1. ✅ Configure GitHub repository and CI/CD pipeline:
   - Initialized Git repository and pushed code to GitHub
   - Set up all required GitHub Secrets for deployment
   - Configured GitHub Actions workflow file to deploy on push to master branch

2. ✅ Implement PHP-based restart solution for SiteGround:
   - Created secure restart-app.php script
   - Added script to GitHub Actions deployment workflow
   - Documented the process in docs/remote-restart-solution.md

3. Run database validation script to verify schema integrity:
   ```bash
   npm run db:verify-indexes
   ```
4. Create pre-deployment backup:
   ```bash
   npm run pre-deploy
   ```
5. Run comprehensive production readiness check:
   ```bash
   npm run pre-deploy-check
   ```
6. Deploy to pricehawk.app using GitHub Actions workflow:
   ```bash
   # Simply push changes to the master branch
   git add .
   git commit -m "Finalize PHP restart script for SiteGround deployment"
   git push
   ```
7. Trigger application restart after deployment:
   ```
   Visit: https://pricehawk.app/restart-app.php?token=PrH_7f2c91d83b4e5a6f
   ```

### Phase 2: Post-Deployment Verification
1. Check health endpoint to verify application status
2. Test critical workflows (authentication, product tracking, alerts, subscriptions)
3. Monitor error logs for any issues during first 24 hours

### Phase 3: Future Enhancement Opportunities
1. Fix remaining TypeScript type declaration errors for client components
2. Enhance dashboard with more comprehensive data visualizations
3. Add interactive features to price history charts
4. Implement more advanced dropshipper analytics
5. Support additional retailers beyond current integrations
