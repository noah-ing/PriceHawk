# Active Development Context

## Current Task
PriceHawk is production ready with a newly added dropshipper-focused dashboard that provides profit metrics and markup settings. This enhancement directly addresses the dashboard shortcomings by providing meaningful data and useful information for users, particularly dropshippers and resellers.

## Recent Changes

  - Created UserProductSettings model in database for storing markup preferences
  - Implemented product-specific markup settings that persist per user
  - Added real-time profit calculations (selling price, profit, markup, margins)
  - Created dropshipper-specific product cards with ROI ratings and profit metrics
  - Added visual indicators for price trends to aid buying decisions
  - Fixed TypeScript interfaces for consistent type safety across components

### Pricing Page Subscription Display Fix (Latest Work - Mar 12, 2025)
- ✅ Fixed "Current Plan" button on Free tier when user is subscribed to another plan:
  - Ensured Free tier doesn't incorrectly display as current plan when it's not
  - Updated data fetching logic to properly process API response structure
  - Improved subscription data handling to correctly identify current tier

### Final Pre-Production Improvements (Previously Completed)
- ✅ Fixed React hooks ordering issues in authentication flow:
  - Resolved "Cannot update a component while rendering a different component" error
  - Ensured consistent hooks ordering by moving logic inside useEffect
  - Added proper error handling with try/catch for navigation operations
  - Improved state management to track redirection status
  - Created a reliable pattern for conditional rendering

- ✅ Fixed pricing page subscription display issue:
  - Updated the subscription data fetching logic to match the subscription page implementation
  - Added better tier name extraction and improved logging
  - Removed "YOUR PLAN" badge from pricing page entirely
  - Added tier name normalization to ensure consistent subscription display

- ✅ Fixed Next.js configuration for ES modules compatibility:
  - Updated next.config.js to use ES module syntax instead of CommonJS
  - Ensured compatibility with "type": "module" in package.json
  - Fixed development server startup issues

- ✅ Resolved CSRF token validation failures:
  - Enhanced token handling with more frequent refreshes (5 min interval vs 15 min)
  - Created auto-retry mechanism for CSRF validation failures
  - Added special handling for critical endpoints (scrape, products, alerts)
  - Implemented more aggressive token freshness checking

- ✅ Created comprehensive dropshipper-focused landing page:
  - Strong value proposition focused on profit maximization 
  - Interactive ROI calculator to demonstrate potential savings
  - Feature showcase highlighting profit-focused capabilities
  - Testimonials from successful dropshippers
  - Clear CTAs for conversion

- ✅ Created detailed pre-deployment documentation:
  - Step-by-step deployment checklist
  - Environment configuration verification
  - Database migration and backup procedures
  - Post-deployment verification steps

### Production Readiness Infrastructure (Previously Completed)
- ✅ Rate limiting middleware with subscription-tier awareness for authentication and scraping protection
- ✅ Comprehensive health check endpoint (/api/health) with database connectivity verification
- ✅ Pre-deployment database backup script with versioning support
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow for automated deployment to SiteGround
- ✅ Production readiness verification script to validate deployment prerequisites
- ✅ Detailed deployment guide with step-by-step instructions

### Security Enhancements (Previously Completed)
- ✅ Tiered rate limiting system that scales with subscription levels
- ✅ Protected authentication routes from brute force attacks
- ✅ Added safeguards for scraping operations to prevent retailer blocking
- ✅ Created CSRF protection with token validation
- ✅ Enhanced JWT token handling with better null-safety and error recovery

## Status
- ✅ User authentication fully functional with Google OAuth and password-based login
- ✅ Authentication flow fixed with proper React hooks ordering
- ✅ Product creation and alert management working correctly with CSRF protection enabled
- ✅ NextJS App Router parameter handling fixed for dynamic routes
- ✅ CSRF token handling improved with automatic retry mechanism
- ✅ Rate limiting implemented across all critical endpoints
- ✅ Health check endpoint created and tested
- ✅ Database optimization verified and automated
- ✅ Deployment pipeline configured
- ✅ Production documentation completed
- ✅ Production verification scripts implemented
- ✅ Subscription sync mechanism unified across all pages
- ✅ AlertsPanel fixed for proper product data handling
- ✅ Price history chart redesigned for dropshipper focus
- ✅ Error handling for API response structure variations implemented
- ✅ Dropshipper-focused landing page completed
- ✅ Pricing page subscription display fixed to correctly reflect current plan

## Next Steps

### Phase 0: Outstanding Issues for Post-Launch Improvement
1. **Dashboard Data Enhancement**
   - Current dashboard displays product listings with minimal data
   - Need more comprehensive product information display
   - Add detailed specs, availability, and actionable insights
   - Create more useful visualizations beyond basic price charts

2. **Alert System Testing**
   - Need comprehensive testing of alert triggering and notifications
   - Add more robust alert management features
   - Implement alert history and effectiveness tracking
   - Create alert priority system with better categorization

### Phase 1: Production Deployment
1. Run database validation script to verify schema integrity:
   ```bash
   npm run db:verify-indexes
   ```
2. Create pre-deployment backup:
   ```bash
   npm run pre-deploy
   ```
3. Run comprehensive production readiness check:
   ```bash
   npm run pre-deploy-check
   ```
4. Deploy to pricehawk.app using GitHub Actions workflow or manual deployment

### Phase 2: Post-Deployment Verification
1. Check health endpoint to verify application status
2. Test critical workflows (authentication, product tracking, alerts, subscriptions)
3. Monitor error logs for any issues during first 24 hours

### Phase 3: Dashboard Enhancements
1. Implement enhanced product data cards
2. Add interactive features to price history charts
3. Create comparison views for better retailer price tracking
4. Implement deal rating system with clear buying recommendations
5. Add summary metrics that better demonstrate subscription value

### Phase 4: Alert System Improvements
1. Thoroughly test alert triggering under various price scenarios
2. Verify notification timing and delivery
3. Add alert history and effectiveness metrics
4. Implement alert priority system for better management
5. Create visual indicators of active alerts on dashboard

### Phase 5: Growth Features
1. Support additional retailers (Target, Newegg, eBay, Etsy)
2. Create a referral system for user acquisition
3. Implement price prediction algorithms using historical data
