# PriceHawk: Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

PriceHawk exists to solve a fundamental consumer problem: people frequently overpay for products due to:

1. **Price Volatility**: Online prices fluctuate constantly based on demand, inventory, and competitive positioning
2. **Time Constraints**: Manually checking prices across multiple retailers is time-consuming and impractical
3. **Missed Opportunities**: Without constant monitoring, consumers miss price drops and sales
4. **Decision Paralysis**: Without historical price context, consumers can't determine if current prices represent good value
