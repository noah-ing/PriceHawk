# Dashboard Improvements Required

## Current State
The dashboard currently has several issues that need to be addressed before production:

1. Layout issues - overlapping components and messy display
2. Limited useful information for users
3. Lack of meaningful data visualization
4. Missing historical price data display that would justify subscription value
5. Products are listed but with minimal product data, making it unhelpful for users

## Requested Improvements

### 1. Price History Visualization
- Add 30-day price history charts for each tracked product
- Implement interactive charts with zoom/pan capabilities 
- Display price trends (increasing, decreasing, stable) with visual indicators
- Show historical high/low price points for better context

### 2. Data-Rich Dashboard Components
- Add "Price Insights" section showing potential savings across all tracked products
- Create "Retailer Comparison" panel to show price differences between stores
- Implement "Deal Rating" system to indicate how good current prices are
- Display "Price Drop Alerts" section more prominently
- Add more detailed product information (specifications, availability, reviews)
- Include actionable insights for each product (buy now, wait for price drop, etc.)

### 3. Layout and UI Fixes
- Fix overlapping elements in current dashboard layout
- Improve responsive design for better mobile experience
- Create more structured grid layout for product cards
- Implement proper spacing between dashboard elements

### 4. Subscription Value Features
- Add features that clearly demonstrate value of paid subscription
- Implement comparative views showing benefits of upgraded tiers
- Create summary statistics (money saved, price drops caught, etc.)
- Add exportable reports for Pro subscribers

### 5. Alert System Testing and Enhancements
- Comprehensively test alert triggering and notifications
- Improve alert visualization and management
- Add alert history and effectiveness tracking
- Create alert priority system and categorization

## Implementation Priority
1. **CRITICAL**: Fix layout and overlapping issues first
2. Add basic 30-day price history visualization next
3. Implement price trend indicators and deal rating
4. Add comparative retailer pricing
5. Enhance product data display with more detailed information
6. Test and improve alert system functionality

## Technical Approach
- Review flex/grid implementation in dashboard.tsx
- Ensure responsive breakpoints are properly defined
- Utilize the existing price-history-chart.tsx component, but enhance with more interactive features
- Consider using existing UI components like Card, Chart, and Alert for consistency
- Enhance product cards to display more comprehensive product information
- Implement a more robust alert management system with proper testing

## Reference from User Feedback
The user specifically mentioned:
> "We have no useful info for users on the dashboard, just a random value, no charts with 30d prev price history, or anything worth subscribing for with the exception of alerts."

> "Our products are listed but there is hardly any data on the products. It just doesn't seem very helpful for users yet."

These concerns should be directly addressed with the improvements outlined above, with particular focus on:
1. Enhanced product data display
2. Interactive price history visualization
3. Useful insights and recommendations
4. Comprehensive alert system testing
