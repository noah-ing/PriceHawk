# Pre-Production Issues and Findings

## Overview
This document catalogues the issues identified during final pre-production testing on March 12, 2025. These items should be addressed before the production release.

## Current Issues

No current outstanding issues. All identified pre-production issues have been fixed and documented below.

## Resolved Issues

### 1. CSRF Token Validation ✅ RESOLVED
- **Issue**: CSRF token validation was failing on some form submissions
- **Evidence**: Server logs showed "Missing CSRF token" or "CSRF token expired" errors when submitting forms
- **Specifically**: Observed in API scrape endpoint (`POST /api/scrape`, `POST /api/products`)
- **Impact**: Users could not add products through URL input when CSRF protection was active
- **Root Cause**: Token was expiring too quickly and not being properly refreshed
- **Fix Implemented**:
  - Enhanced token handling with more frequent refreshes (5 min interval vs 15 min)
  - Created auto-retry mechanism for CSRF validation failures
  - Added special handling for critical endpoints (scrape, products, alerts)
  - Implemented more aggressive token freshness checking
- **Verification**: Products can now be added successfully with CSRF protection enabled, no token errors observed

### 2. Dashboard UI Issues ✅ RESOLVED
- **Issue**: Dashboard layout was messy and had overlapping elements
- **Fix Implemented**: Completely revamped price history chart with improved layout and spacing constraints
  - Fixed chart overlapping issues with proper container sizing
  - Improved responsive design for all screen sizes
  - Added product navigation tabs in history page for better organization
  - Optimized metrics display with clean grid layout
- **Verification**: Chart now displays properly with no overlapping elements

### 3. Subscription Display Inconsistency ✅ RESOLVED
- **Issue**: Pricing plan page showed the wrong subscription plan as current
- **Fix Implemented**: Updated pricing page to use the same subscription sync mechanism as the subscription page
  - Added "Sync with Stripe" button for manual synchronization
  - Implemented same data fetching logic with cache busting and force refresh
  - Used consistent subscription state management across the application
- **Verification**: Pricing page now correctly displays the user's current plan matching Stripe data

### 4. Stripe Synchronization ✅ RESOLVED
- **Issue**: Subscription tier not properly reflected throughout the application
- **Fix Implemented**: 
  - Unified subscription data fetching mechanism across all pages
  - Implemented consistent use of force-sync endpoint
  - Added proper cache control headers and params for subscription data
  - Improved error handling for subscription status API
- **Verification**: Manual sync now correctly updates the subscription tier throughout the application

### 5. Routing Conflict Resolution
- **Issue**: Routing conflict between scraper-test page and catch-all route
- **Evidence**: Console error: "You cannot define a route with the same specificity as a optional catch-all route"
- **Status**: Resolved by replacing catch-all route with a simple redirect in the main page file
- **Verification**: Dev server starts without routing errors after fix

### 6. Cache Serialization
- **Status**: Fixed with comprehensive error handling for Redis cache serialization/deserialization
- **Verification**: No cache-related errors observed in terminal output
- **Notes**: Cache hits are properly logged and working for product price history

## Next Steps

### Production Deployment
All identified pre-production issues have been successfully resolved. The application is now ready for production deployment.

### Final Pre-Deployment Checklist
1. **Run Comprehensive Production Readiness Check**:
   ```bash
   npm run pre-deploy-check
   ```

2. **Create Database Backup**:
   ```bash
   npm run pre-deploy
   ```
   
   Note: If using the pg_dump tool, ensure it's compatible with the PostgreSQL server version (17.4).

3. **Apply Database Migrations**:
   ```bash 
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```
   
   This will apply all pending migrations, including the missing indexes.

4. **Deploy Using GitHub Actions Workflow**:
   Follow the deployment guide in `docs/deployment-guide.md` for step-by-step instructions.

### Post-Deployment Verification
1. Check health endpoint to verify application status
2. Test critical workflows (authentication, product tracking, alerts, subscriptions)
3. Verify Stripe webhook configuration for subscription management
4. Monitor error logs for any issues during first 24 hours
