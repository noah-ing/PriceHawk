# PriceHawk: Next Development Phase

## Prioritized Development Tasks

Based on our recent pre-production testing on March 12, 2025, we've identified several critical issues that need to be addressed before full production deployment. After resolving these issues, we'll focus on enhancing user experience and implementing growth features.

### Critical Pre-Production Issues

1. **Dashboard Data Enhancement and UI**
   - Fix limited product data display - currently products are listed with minimal useful information
   - Implement comprehensive product data cards with specifications, availability, and reviews
   - Add meaningful visualizations and actionable insights for each product
   - Create detailed price comparison views between retailers
   - Implement deal rating system with clear buying recommendations

2. **Alert System Testing and Enhancement**
   - Thoroughly test alert triggering mechanisms across different price scenarios
   - Verify notification delivery and timing across email channels
   - Implement alert history and effectiveness tracking
   - Create alert priority system with user-configurable settings
   - Add visual indicators of active alerts on the dashboard

3. **CSRF Token Validation**
   - ✅ Fix token expiration handling and client-side retry mechanisms
   - ✅ Test all form submissions with CSRF protection enabled
   - ✅ Ensure proper token passing from client to server

4. **Subscription Display Standardization**
   - ✅ Update pricing plan page to use consistent naming across all tiers
   - ✅ Fix "Current Plan" display bug on Basic Free Plan
   - ✅ Verify automatic synchronization with Stripe works consistently

5. **Streamline Navigation**
   - Complete the advanced-search redirection from scraper-test
   - Ensure consistent user experience across all pages

## Priority Tasks for Post-Launch Phase

### 1. User Experience Enhancements
   - Add interactive features to price history charts (zoom/pan/date selection)
   - Implement batch operations for product and alert management
   - Improve mobile responsiveness across all views
   - Add real-time notifications for price changes

### 2. Growth Features
   - Support additional retailers (Target, Newegg, eBay, Etsy)
   - Create a referral system for user acquisition
   - Implement price prediction algorithms using historical data
   - Add deal quality scoring system

### Recently Implemented Improvements
   - Fixed React hooks ordering issues in authentication flow:
     - Resolved "Cannot update a component while rendering a different component" error
     - Ensured all hooks are called unconditionally at the top level of components
     - Implemented proper error handling for navigation operations with try/catch
     - Added state management to track redirection status and prevent loops
   - Fixed pricing page subscription display to correctly reflect current subscription tier
   - Fixed "Current Plan" button on Free tier when user is subscribed to another plan
   - Enhanced Stripe subscription synchronization
   - Optimized font loading with preloading and proper fallbacks for better performance
   - Improved authentication flow with optimized redirects and session handling
   - Implemented intelligent anti-bot detection for Walmart with user-friendly error messages
   - Fixed GitHub Actions workflow with proper environment variable handling 
   - Enhanced scraper architecture to handle retailer-specific limitations gracefully

### 3. Analytics and Optimization
   - Set up user behavior tracking
   - Create performance dashboards for key metrics
   - Implement A/B testing framework for feature optimization
   - Add business analytics for conversion and retention metrics

### 4. Integration and Extensions
   - Create browser extension for easy product addition
   - Implement webhook API for third-party integrations
   - Add social sharing capabilities for price drops
   - Create public API with developer documentation

## Technical Approach

Continue using the established patterns and infrastructure:

1. **React Hooks Best Practices**:
   - Always call hooks at the top level of components unconditionally
   - Move conditional logic inside hooks instead of conditional hook calls
   - Manage navigation with useEffect instead of during render
   - Use proper state tracking for redirects and loading states

2. **Dashboard Improvements**:
   - Enhance product cards to display comprehensive product information
   - Implement flexible layout grid to prevent overflow and element collision
   - Create consistent data visualization components for price history
   - Add interactive elements that demonstrate the value of paid subscriptions

3. **Repository Pattern**: All database operations go through dedicated repositories
4. **Service Layer**: Business logic is contained in service classes
5. **API Middleware**: Use the middleware pattern for cross-cutting concerns
6. **Next.js Architecture**: Leverage the App Router pattern for page organization
7. **TypeScript**: Maintain strong typing throughout the codebase

## Production Environment

The application is deployed to pricehawk.app with:

- **SiteGround Hosting**: Node.js environment with PM2 process management
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Optimized with proper indexes and connection pooling
- **Stripe Integration**: Subscription management and payment processing
- **SendGrid Email**: Transactional emails for alerts and notifications

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy new changes to production:

1. Verify changes meet production standards:
   ```bash
   npm run pre-deploy-check
   ```

2. Create a pre-deployment backup:
   ```bash
   npm run pre-deploy
   ```

3. Push changes to the main branch to trigger deployment or manually deploy:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

4. Verify deployment success:
   ```bash
   curl https://pricehawk.app/api/health
