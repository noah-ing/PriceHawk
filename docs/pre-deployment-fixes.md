# PriceHawk: Pre-Deployment Fixes & Production Checklist

This document outlines the critical fixes implemented just before production deployment and provides a final checklist for going live with PriceHawk.

## Recent Fixes Summary

### 1. Pricing Page Subscription Display Fix
- **Issue**: The pricing page showed incorrect "Current Plan" status, not reflecting the actual user's subscription
- **Fix**: 
  - Updated the subscription data fetching logic to match the implementation in the subscription page
  - Added better tier name extraction from subscription data
  - Improved logging for debugging subscription issues

### 2. CSRF Token Enhancement
- **Issue**: CSRF token validation was failing on some form submissions (particularly in API scrape endpoint)
- **Fixes**:
  - Reduced token refresh interval from 15 minutes to 5 minutes
  - Made token freshness checks more aggressive (refresh tokens older than 10 minutes)
  - Added special handling for critical endpoints (scrape, products, alerts)
  - Implemented automatic retry with fresh tokens when CSRF errors occur
  - Added additional logging to help diagnose token validation issues
  - Enhanced error handling with better recovery mechanisms

### 3. React Hooks Ordering Fix
- **Issue**: React hooks order error during authentication flows causing problems with login/logout lifecycle
- **Fixes**:
  - Ensured all hooks are called at the top level unconditionally
  - Moved conditional logic inside hooks rather than conditional hook calls
  - Added explicit error handling for navigation failures
  - Used consistent rendering patterns for loading states
  - Added state management to prevent multiple redirects
  - Fixed component lifecycle to maintain consistent hook ordering between renders

### 4. Landing Page Creation
- **Feature**: Created a comprehensive dropshipper-focused landing page
- **Implementation**:
  - Strong value proposition highlighting profit maximization
  - Interactive ROI calculator for dropshippers to see potential savings
  - Testimonials from successful dropshippers
  - Feature showcase highlighting dropshipper-specific functionality
  - Clear CTAs guiding users to sign up or view pricing plans

## Production Deployment Checklist

### 1. Pre-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Run database validation script to verify schema integrity:
  ```bash
  npm run db:verify-indexes
  ```

- [ ] Create pre-deployment backup:
  ```bash
  npm run pre-deploy
  ```

- [ ] Run comprehensive production readiness check:
  ```bash
  npm run pre-deploy-check
  ```

### 2. CSRF Protection Configuration

- [x] Confirm CSRF protection is enabled for all state-changing API routes:
  - `app/api/products/route.ts`: `csrfProtection: true`
  - `app/api/alerts/route.ts`: `csrfProtection: true`
  - `app/api/scrape/route.ts`: `csrfProtection: true`

### 3. Environment Configuration

- [ ] Set all required environment variables in production environment:
  - Database connection strings
  - Auth secrets and provider keys
  - Stripe API keys and webhook secrets
  - SendGrid API keys and email templates
  - CSRF and authentication secrets

- [ ] Validate environment variable setup:
  ```bash
  # Run the environment configuration check
  node scripts/check-env-vars.js
  ```

### 4. Database Migration

- [ ] Run final database migration in production:
  ```bash
  npm run migrate:prod
  ```

- [ ] Verify database indexes are properly created:
  ```bash
  npm run db:verify-indexes
  ```

### 5. Deployment Process

- [ ] Configure GitHub repository secrets for CI/CD pipeline:
  - `SITEGROUND_FTP_HOST`: FTP hostname for SiteGround
  - `SITEGROUND_FTP_USERNAME`: FTP username
  - `SITEGROUND_FTP_PASSWORD`: FTP password
  - `SITEGROUND_SSH_HOST`: SSH hostname for remote commands
  - `SITEGROUND_SSH_USERNAME`: SSH username
  - `SITEGROUND_SSH_KEY`: SSH private key for authentication

- [ ] Trigger deployment via GitHub Actions:
  ```bash
  # Push to main branch to trigger deployment
  git push origin main
  ```

- [ ] Alternative: Manual deployment:
  ```bash
  npm run deploy
  ```

### 6. Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Check health endpoint to verify application status:
  ```bash
  curl https://pricehawk.app/api/health
  ```

- [ ] Test critical workflows:
  - User registration and authentication
  - Product tracking with URL input
  - Alert creation and management
  - Subscription management
  - Password reset functionality

- [ ] Monitor error logs for any issues during first 24 hours
