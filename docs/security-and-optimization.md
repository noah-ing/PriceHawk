# PriceHawk: Security and Performance Optimization

This document outlines the security and performance enhancements implemented to make PriceHawk production-ready.

## Security Enhancements

### 1. CSRF Protection

We've implemented a comprehensive Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection framework:

- **Server-Side Protection**:
  - `csrf-protection.ts`: Core middleware that generates secure tokens and validates requests
  - `secured-api.ts`: Combined middleware that applies CSRF protection alongside error handling
  - Rate limiting based on IP address and endpoint type
  - Secure token storage with expiration

- **Client-Side Integration**:
  - `CsrfToken.tsx`: React component for adding CSRF tokens to forms
  - `useCsrfToken()`: Hook for obtaining tokens in React Hook Form
  - `useFetchWithCsrf()`: Hook for adding CSRF tokens to fetch requests

- **Token API Endpoint**:
  - `/api/csrf/token`: Endpoint for generating and retrieving CSRF tokens

### 2. Error Handling Framework

We've implemented a comprehensive error handling system:

- **Server-Side Error Handling**:
  - Standardized error format and categorization
  - Centralized logging with severity levels
  - Consistent HTTP status codes and error messages
  - Request tracking with unique transaction IDs

- **Client-Side Error Recovery**:
  - `ErrorBoundary.tsx`: React error boundary for graceful component failure
  - Support for retry operations after errors
  - Custom fallback UI for specific components

### 3. Authentication Hardening

The authentication system has been hardened with:

- CSRF protection for all state-changing operations
- Token verification with timing-safe comparison
- Simple JWT wrapper compatible with NextAuth
- Basic session validation

Note: We initially implemented an advanced JWT wrapper with pre-flight validation, token refresh, and sophisticated error handling, but encountered compatibility issues with NextAuth's JWT implementation. We simplified the JWT wrapper to use direct pass-through to NextAuth's functions to resolve these issues.

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Database Optimization

PostgreSQL database performance has been optimized with:

- **Connection Pooling**:
  - Configured connection pooling parameters for optimized database connections
  - Set appropriate timeouts for connection acquisition and idle connections
  - Added connection limit configuration to prevent resource exhaustion

- **Strategic Indexing**:
  - Composite indexes for time-series queries (`price_history_productId_timestamp_idx`)
  - Indexes for filtering alerts by status (`alert_userId_status_idx`)
  - Optimized indexes for product lookup and filtering
  - Indexes for user subscription status queries

### 2. API Optimization

API performance has been enhanced with:

- **Middleware Streamlining**:
  - Combined multiple middleware to reduce processing overhead
  - Added performance metrics headers to track response times
  - Implemented request ID propagation for tracing

- **Rate Limiting**:
  - Configurable rate limits based on endpoint sensitivity
  - Different limits for authentication, API, and scraping endpoints
  - Proper retry signaling with standard headers

## Implementation Details

### Middleware Architecture

```
Request → API Error Handler → CSRF Protection → Route Handler → Response
```

### Database Schema Enhancements

The following database schema enhancements were implemented:

1. Added `status` and `triggeredAt` fields to the `Alert` model
2. Added `lastCheckedAt` field to the `Product` model
3. Created composite indexes for optimal query performance
4. Added subscription-related indexes to the `User` model

### Security Flow

```
1. Client requests CSRF token from /api/csrf/token
2. Server generates token, stores in cache, and sets cookie
3. Client includes token in form or fetch request
4. Server validates token on state-changing operations
5. Request proceeds only if token is valid
```

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**:
   - Test CSRF protection with real forms
   - Verify database optimization with query performance monitoring
   - Test error handling with simulated failures

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Set up logging infrastructure to capture errors
   - Configure performance metrics collection
   - Create dashboards for system health monitoring

3. **Additional Enhancements**:
   - Implement content compression for API responses
   - Add pagination for list endpoints
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
